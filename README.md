# WA_ToDoList
Project Number 1

Initial Scope
I want to make a ToDoList by entering tasks with the location into the application, as you approach the location entered, it will automatically cross it off the todolist.

Ok successfully recommited vs code under new name. Moving from here will be debugging why I can't push from terminal, and beginning the skeleton of the application ToDoList.
